# Chapter 2: An Exploratory Study of Different Types of Low-code Software Applications.

This repository contains replication package for Chapter 2 of the thesis.

## Overview
For this study, we characterize the overall LCSD into two types: traditional  and machine-learning software development solutions. We undertake a qualitative analysis of **121 traditional LCSD platforms** and **37 ML LCSD services** to determine what types of application development, licensing, and deployment flexibility they provide. The findings of this study provide a comprehensive overview of the present status of global LCSD services.
